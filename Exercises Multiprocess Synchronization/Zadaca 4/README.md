Dancing with the Students 2.0 Problem 1 (0 / 0)

Additional exercise for Task 1:

    We now also welcome children to the dance
    They can use a third changing room which also has a limit of 10 students
    After they get dressed, they first act as a female dancer and offer themselves to a male dancer(if there is one ready) and they form a pair
    If no male dancer is free, they act as a male dancer and wait for a dressed female to form a pair with
    The maximum number of dancing pairs is still 3
